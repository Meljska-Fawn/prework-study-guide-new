# Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

The purpose of this project was to compile notes while completing the prework in order to reference back to while building webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a great community resource for bootcamp students to share what knowledge they found valuable in the readings. By having website links to share amoungst peers, students can add to their own webpage study guides as they discover information on their peers webpages. I learned about some basic code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a user friendly webpage. I am excited to build upon this foundation.
